# RAG Starter Project

This project is a learning sandbox for understanding **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG).  
We will start from scratch and build up to a working RAG pipeline that uses embeddings, vector search, and LLMs.

## ðŸ“Œ Goal for Day 1
- Learn what embeddings are and how to measure similarity between them.
- Store embeddings in a vector store (FAISS).
- Run a query to retrieve the closest match.
